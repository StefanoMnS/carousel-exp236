### dashboard that can carousel multiple cards


#### Exp-236 Carousel

----

- Targets these page(s):  DLP, PLP, PDP
- About experiment:

   - Scrolls sideways, touch/drag under `1025px`, over it shows `left/right` arrows

   - Shows right arrow, margin-left - check dots some of this things are linked to last one

   - Needs to be a container for the homepage dashboard that can hold multiple cards - each card needs to have it's own rules/logic.
```
   - `If a user has no cards available then the container should not show`
```
   - If multiple cards are shown, then the cards shuld be scrollable sideways
   - Needs to include the greeting and first name (if user signed in)

```
   - Little X on the cards to remove individual messages - if all messages have been removed by a user, then dashboard should disappear
```
